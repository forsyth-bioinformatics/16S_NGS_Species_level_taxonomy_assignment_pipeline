# 16S_NGS_Species_level_taxonomy_assignment_pipeline
This is the updated version of the pipeline described in this paper:
Al-Hebshi NN, Nasher AT, Idris AM, Chen T. Robust species taxonomy assignment algorithm for 16S rRNA NGS reads: 
application to oral carcinoma samples. J Oral Microbiol. 2015 Sep 29;7:28934. doi: 10.3402/jom.v7.28934. 
PMID: 26426306; PMCID: PMC4590409.

The updated pipeline includes the assignment of a potential "novel" species for reads with <98% identify to any of the reference sequences.
